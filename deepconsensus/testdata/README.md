# DeepConsensus Test Data

**New test data setup**

With the pipeline moving to a pysam based approach, new test data is needed.
This test data can be generated by running generate_testdata.sh in this
directory.

*   `human_1m` - Derived from a human_1m dataset
*   `preprocess` - Simple toy datasets for testing preprocessing.

**Old test data setup**

To regenerate the files under `learning/genomics/deepconsensus/testdata`, run
the below command. You will need to do this if you have modified the data
processing code in a way that changes the outputs from each Beam pipeline
(`merge_datasets`, `generate_input`, `write_tf_examples`).

```
time ./learning/genomics/deepconsensus/scripts/generate_testdata.sh
```

This command should take ~6 min to complete.
